# 🧬 Evolution Simulator (WIP)

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress:**  
> This project is actively evolving as I continue learning and building. It’s messy, unfinished, and full of rough edges.  
> I’m making it public to share the journey, not just the destination.

## 🧠 Overview

This is a Python-based evolution simulator featuring agents that attempt to survive in a 2D environment. Each agent operates based on needs like hunger, thirst, and eventually reproduction. When needs aren't met, the agents die, and *ideally* their genetic data is used to evolve new ones with slight mutations.

This simulator serves as both a creative sandbox and a stepping stone into implementing neural networks and emergent AI behavior.

## 🛠️ Current Features

- Autonomous agents with randomized starting behaviors
- Food and water resource generation
- Energy-based survival logic (consume to live, move to burn)
- Visual simulation using `pygame`
- Modular architecture (entities, metabolism, behavior, utils)

## 🔮 In Development / Planned

- Genetic inheritance and mutations
- Evolving behavioral traits based on environment and fitness
- Neural network-driven decision making
- Predator/prey dynamics
- Terrain and environmental obstacles
- Interactive simulation tuning

## 📚 Why This Exists

This isn't just a code project—it's a personal deep dive into systems thinking, behavioral logic, and AI evolution. It’s being built incrementally as a learning tool, and may one day power real robotic motion logic if im willing to dust off the3D printer and soldering iron. 

## 🧩 Stack

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` for visualization
- `math`, `random`, `dataclasses`, and standard libs

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This project is mid-growth, mid-mess.. Expect bugs. Expect half-finished features. But idk.. things take work and a little bit of persistance.
